### Compiler generating the target code secured against reverse analysis

Visual Studio Code extension for syntax highlighting of the Jabukód programming language created for my
bachelor thesis <i>Compiler generating the target code secured against reverse analysis</i> to ease writing
custom programs.

- This extension is not available online through Visual Studio Code marketplace.
To use it, insert this diretory in your `~/.vscode/extensions/` directory. Files append with the `.jk`
filename extension will automatically have Jabukód-style highlighting.

<!--- To compile custom Jabukód programs, you can find the Jabukód compiler at //TODO LINK TO PUBLIC REPO-->
